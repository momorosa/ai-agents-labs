# AI Agent Labs

This repository contains hands-on experiments and learning labs focused on building **AI agents and multi-agent systems** using Google’s **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Understand agentic architectures beyond prompt-based LLMs
- Explore tool use, orchestration patterns, and agent workflows
- Experiment locally with custom tools, MCP concepts, and agent observability

## What’s inside
- Single-agent and multi-agent examples
- Custom tool implementations (Python functions as agent tools)
- Sequential, parallel, and loop-based agent workflows
- Local ADK + Web UI experimentation

## Notes
- This repo is not a production system
- API keys are managed locally via `.env` 
- Code is intentionally kept simple to focus on concepts
